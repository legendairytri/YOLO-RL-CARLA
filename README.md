# System Requirements
_The requirements are based on the computers we have access to. I will attempt to list the requirements in a manner that can be adapted for each user._

## Computer Configuration
- Ubuntu 18.02
- Python 3.8  
- CARLA 9.14
- Cuda 11.6
- Pytorch 1.12.1
- GPU Driver

_The CUDA integration is essential for the YOLO code, so that is why there is the emphasis on getting the versioning correct here at the start._

## Necessary Downloads
### CARLA
Download CARLA_0.9.14.tar.gz from [CARLA_0.9.14](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.9.14/)
Extract CARLA simulator to desired location.

### YOLO Code
Download zip file of [YOLO code](https://github.com/ferdialaca/Carla_Detection_YOLOv5)
Extract YOLO code into examples folder of CARLA simulator. 
> base folder/CARLA/PythonAPI/examples
